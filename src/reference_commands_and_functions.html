	    This page provides a <strong>reference guide that describes the details of the commands
		and functions</strong> that Karel understands.

		You may also want to read an <a href="reference_overview.html">overview of Karel's world
			and what it can do.</a>.

	    <div class="reference_subheading">Karel's ACTION Functions:</div>
	    <p>
		<dl>
	      <dt>move()</dt>
	        <dd>
				Move Karel forward exactly one position, in the direction it is facing.
				If Karel hits a wall, that is considered a program error!
			</dd>
		  <dt>turnRight()</dt>
	        <dd>
			    Turns Karel 90 degrees clockwise.
			</dd>
		  <dt>pickBeeper()</dt>
	        <dd>
				Karel will pick up a beeper at the current intersection and place it in its backpack. 
				If there is no beeper on the ground at that intersection
				to pick up, that is considered a program error!
			</dd>
		  <dt>putBeeper()</dt>
	        <dd>
				Karel will take a beeper out of its backpackage, and 
				place it on the ground at the current intersection.
				If Karel's backpack is empty, then Karel obviously cannot fulfill this 
				instruction; that is considered a program error!
			</dd>
        </dl>

		<div class="reference_subheading">Karel's SENSOR functions:</div>
	    <p>
		Karel understands many built-in sensor-input <strong>functions</strong> which return information 
		about the outside world (e.g. which direction Karel is facing, whether there is a wall in 
		front of Karel, etc.)  All of the functions that
		begin with 'is' return either true or false, boolean values which can be tested directly within
		an 'if' or 'while' statement. 
		<dl>
	      <dt>isFacingNorth(), isFacingSouth(), isFacingEast(), isFacingWest()</dt>
	        <dd>
			    Each returns true if Karel is facing the corresponding direction and returns false otherwise.
			</dd>
		  <dt>isFrontBlocked(), isLeftBlocked(), isRightBlocked()</dt>
	        <dd>
			    Each returns true if a wall or boundary is in front of, to the left of, or to the right of
				Karel, respectively, or returns false otherwise. These are the opposites of the isXXXClear()
				functions.
			</dd>
		  <dt>isFrontClear(), isLeftClear(), isRightClear()</dt>
	        <dd>
			    Each returns true if a wall or boundary is NOT in front of, to the left of, or to the right of
				Karel, respectively, or returns false otherwise. These are the opposites of the isXXXBlocked()
				functions.
			</dd>
		  <dt>isNextToABeeper(), isNotNextToABeeper()</dt>
	        <dd>
			    These sensor functions lets your program check to see 
	    if there is at least one beeper on the ground at the
	    intersection where Karel currently stands.
			</dd>
		  <dt>isAnyBeepersInBackpack(), isNoBeepersInBackpack()</dt>
	        <dd>
			    These sensor functions lets your program check to see
	    if Karel has any beepers in its backpack.
			</dd>
			<!--
		  <dt>print(msg), assert(condition, msg)</dt>
	        <dd>
			    The print() function doesn't move or otherwise change Karel's state. Instead, it "prints" whatever
				message passed as a parameter to the simulator's log. This is very handy for debugging.
				<br /><br />
				The assert() function tests whether the condition given is true or not. If it is not, the function
				prints the message given. Thus, the message is only shown if some <i>assertion</i> or expectation
				is not being met. This is very handy for debugging.
			</dd>-->
			<!--
		  <dt>clearWorld(maxX,maxY), wall(x,y,direction), karel(x,y,direction), beeper(x,y)</dt>
	        <dd>
			    These commands may be used to create a new world for Karel. Normally, these commands are not
				used since worlds may be quickly and easily loaded using the user interface. The function
				clearWorld takes a number of Avenues and a number of Streets which define the size of Karel's
				world. (NOTE: Maximum 12.) The function karel(x,y,direction) will place Karel at the 
				intersection given by the Avenue number (x) and Street number (y) and place him facing the
				direction given ('north', etc.). The function beeper(x,y) will place a beeper at the
				intersection given.
			</dd> -->
