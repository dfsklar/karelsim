	      <dt>General Comments</dt>
	        <dd>
			Karel lives in a flat world with the standard north, south, east, and west compass points.
			The world is bounded on all four sides<a href="#differences"><super>*</super></a> by boundaries. 
			Karel cannot bump
			into these walls; if it tries to move into one, it will crash.
			<br /><br />
			Crisscrossing the world are horizontal <strong>streets</strong> (running east-west) and vertical
			<strong>avenues</strong> (running north-south). An <strong>intersection</strong> (or street corner or corner) is located
			wherever a street and avenue intersect. Karel can be positioned on any corner, facing
			one of the four compass points. Both streets and avenues are numbered; consequently
			each intersection may be identified by its street and avenue numbers.
			<br /><br />
			The corner of 1st Street and 1st Avenue is named the <strong>origin</strong>. This is
			the most southwesterly corner in Karel's world. Street numbers increase as Karel travels east
			and avenue numbers increase as Karel travels north.
			</dd>
	      <dt>Karel's Location</dt>
	        <dd>
			As mentioned above, Karel will always be located at an intersection within his world,
			and will always be facing north, south, east, or west.
			</dd>
			
		  <dt>Walls</dt>
	        <dd>Within Karel's world may also be one or more <strong>walls</strong>. Just as Karel may not
			move into the boundaries of his world, it may not move into walls within it either. An attempt
			to move into a wall will cause Karel to crash, just like an attempt to move into a boundary.
			</dd>
			
		  <dt>Beepers</dt>
	        <dd>
			Within Karel's world may be zero or more <strong>beepers</strong>. Beepers are small objects that
			emit a quiet beeping noise that Karel can "hear". When present, they are located at intersections
			(like Karel), which means when Karel is at a particular intersection, it might be "next to" a
			beeper, if there is one located where Karel is located. Karel can pick beepers up and put them
			into its backpack, or take them out of its backpack and put them down at the current
			intersection. More than one beeper may be located at any given 
			intersection.
		    </dd>
			
		  <dt>Karel's Backpack</dt>
	        <dd>
			As mentioned above, Karel has a <strong>backpack</strong> into which it can put any number of beepers. The bag is
			made of a material that completely blocks the sound emitted by the beepers. This means that
			Karel will never "accidentally" "hear" a beeper in his bag.  If Karel hears a beeper while at an
			intersection it is because there is a beeper sitting on the ground at that intersection.
